    <h1>This website is a tribute to my Grandfather called Fred</h1>
    <p>While as far as I believe my Grandfather wasn't an activist, he inadvertently inspired my new form of revolution...</p>
    <p>This is The Frederation, a new site that hopes to become an operating system eventually. However, I need your help to make sure this site remains as anonymous and private as possible as my coding knowledge is very basic!</p>
    <p>So where do you come in? My intention for this to be an embeddable OS in all systems; however, I do not condone any illegal activity that could potentially be made with this project, and any mockery of Fred will not be tolerated.</p>
    <ol>
        <h2>Let's make an instructional guide for ever as a lifelong tribute to Fred.</h2>
        <li><h1>Step 1:</h1> Make the intentions clear to people potentially interested!</li>
        <li><h1>Step 2:</h1>
            <p>Some words of wisdom to help you along your way</p>

    <h1>He wouldn't have described himself as a hobbyist or tinkerer, but he certainly was.</h1>

<h1>His Hobbies Were</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Traditional forms of art such as painting</li>
  <li>photography</li>
  <p>He even made an educational computer game to help people learn the alphabet however sadly he never published this. I don't think he ever wanted to although I may add it to this site just üêª in üß† it was made in Delphi and well the graphics give that a way and that's just scratching the surface</p>
