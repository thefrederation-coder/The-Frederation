    <h1>This website is a tribute to my Grandfather called Fred</h1>
    <p>While as far as I believe my Grandfather wasn't an activist he inadvertently inspired my new form of revolution...</p>
    <p>This is The Frederation a new site that hopes to become an operating system eventually but I need your help to make sure this site remains as anonymous and private as possible as my coding knowledge is very basic!</p>
    <p>So where do you come in? My intention for this to be an embeddable OS in all systems however I do not condone any illegal activity that could potentially be made with this project and any mockery of Fred will not be tolerated.</p>
