    <h1>This website is a tribute to my Grandfather called Fred</h1>
    <p>While as far as I believe my Grandfather wasn't an activist, he inadvertently inspired my new form of revolution...</p>
    <p>This is The Frederation, a new site that hopes to become an operating system eventually. However, I need your help to make sure this site remains as anonymous and private as possible as my coding knowledge is very basic!</p>
    <p>So where do you come in? My intention for this to be an embeddable OS in all systems; however, I do not condone any illegal activity that could potentially be made with this project, and any mockery of Fred will not be tolerated.</p>
    <ol>
        <h2>Let's make an instructional guide for ever as a lifelong tribute to Fred.</h2>
        <li><h1>Step 1:</h1> Make the intentions clear to people potentially interested!</li>
        <li><h1>Step 2:</h1>
            <p>Some words of wisdom to help you along your way</p>
